Place your profile image here as `profile.jpg` so the app will display it in the About section.

If you want me to add the attached photo for you, either:

- Upload the image file directly into the workspace (drag into the VS Code explorer), or
- Reply here and I will add it for you if you confirm.

File requirements:

- File path: `public/images/profile.jpg`
- Recommended dimensions: square (e.g., 1024x1024) for best display.
